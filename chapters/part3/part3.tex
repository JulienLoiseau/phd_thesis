\part{Application}

\chapter*{Introduction}
The first part presented the tools needed to understand and target performance in HPC. 
The second part presented a metric showing the benefit of accelerators, in this case GPUs, over classical GPU in two contexts: irregular computation and irregular communication/memory behaviors.
We showed that the accelerators gave a real advantage on those two problems and allows us to push the limits.

In order to conclude this study and our metric we decided to target another irregular behavior problem embedding both computation/communication/memory wall behavior. 
In order to show how accelerators handle real world problems, we searched for an application fulfilling our needs. 
Our choose fell on the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics problem applied to fluid and astrophysics. 
The first version of this application was developed during a 2 months internship at the Los Alamos National Laboratory from the FleCSI framework.

In this part we first present the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics method from a physical point of view and making a parallel with the computer science problems involved. 
The second chapter present our application, FleCSPH. 
Starting from the current FleCSI version we introduce the algorithm and methods to solve efficiently this problem on classical processor and the acceleration generated adding GPUs.
