\chapter*{Introduction}

High Performance Computing, HPC, does not find a strict definition. 
Since computer creation, first dedicated for balistic purposes, domain scientists developped their tool to perform computations. 
Then, in front of the complexity of building such machines, HPC became a dedicated field of research. 

Computer scientists interested in HPC will have to focus on several domains. 
\begin{itemize}
\item The energy consumption, mainly directed by the hardware producers. 
\item The computational power, how to take advantages of the ressources ? 
\item The communication, because such machines are constructed over several machines or nodes. 
\end{itemize}

Domain scientists are also involved directly in HPC with their software and redefining the structure based on their needs and usages.
