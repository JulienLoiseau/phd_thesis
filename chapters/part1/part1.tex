\chapter*{Introduction}

High Performance Computing, HPC, does not find a strict definition. 
Since computer creation, first dedicated for balistic purposes, domain scientists developped their tool to perform computations. 
Then, in front of the complexity of building such machines, HPC became a dedicated field of research. 

Computer scientists interested in HPC will have to focus on several domains. 
\begin{itemize}
\item The energy consumption, mainly directed by the hardware producers. 
\item The computational power, how to take advantages of the ressources ? 
\item The communication, because such machines are constructed over several machines or nodes. 
\end{itemize}

Domain scientists are also involved directly in HPC with their software and redefining the structure based on their needs and usages.

\chapter*{Conclusion}
This part detailed the state of the art theory, hardware and software in High Performance Computing. 
We showed through nowadays example of supercomputers and benchmarks the important change of mind regarding hybrid architectures. 

The question that arise is: can we trust those benchmarks when it comes to rank supercomputers and the architectures that come to be more and more complexes?
