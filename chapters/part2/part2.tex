\section*{Conclusion}
In this part we show the real advantage of accelerators toward classical processor utilization. 
In the Langford problem the GPU have an acceleration of ***** regarding processors. 
It allows us to beat a new world record in term of computational speed in 2015 solving the last instance $L(2,28)$.
