\chapter*{Introduction}

High Performance Computing, HPC, does not find a strict definition. 
HPC became a dedicated field of research. 

Since supercomputer creation, dedicated for balistic purposes, domain scientists and nowaday computer scientists

Computer scientists interested in HPC will have to focus on several domains. 
\begin{itemize}
\item The energy consumption, mainly directed by the hardware producers. 
\item The computational power, how to take advantages of the ressources ? 
\item The communication, because such machines are constructed over several machines or nodes. 
\end{itemize}

Domain scientists are also involved directly in HPC with their software and redefining the structure based on their needs and usages.

\chapter{Theory of HPC and performances}

\section{Introduction}
High Performance Computing (HPC)
HPC focus on performance 

This first chapter will present the different laws and rules that comes from HPC theory and observations. 

The general idea of parallelism is to achieve performance. 
And thus we need to define what performance imply in HPC. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Reducing total time = Latency 
\item Reducing rate of task = Throughput 
\item Reducing \todo{WHAT ?} 
\end{itemize}

\section{Speedup, efficiency and scalability}

\subsection{Speedup and efficiency}
Calling latency the time to computer a time, unit of time. 
The latency is define as the time for number
The lower latency is better. 

Considering $n$ the number of processes and $n=1$ the sequential case.
And $T_n$ the execution time with $n$ processes and $T_1$ the sequential one. 
The speedup can be defined using the latency by the formula: 
\begin{equation}
\text{speedup} = S_n =  \frac{T_1}{T_n}
\end{equation}


\begin{figure}
\centering 
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \draw[->] (-.5,0) -- (4,0) node[right] {$n$};
  \draw[->] (0,-.5) -- (0,2.5) node[above] {$speepup$};
  \draw (0,0) -- (4,2) node[right] {\text{Linear Speedup}};
  \draw (0,0) .. controls (3.5,1.3) .. (4.,1.2) node[right] {\text{Typical Speedup}} ;
  \draw (0,0) .. controls (3.5,2.2) .. (4.,2.2) node[above] {\text{Hyperlinear speedup}} ;
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Observed speedup}
\label{fig:1_HPC:speedup_obs}
\end{figure}

As shown on figure \ref{fig:1_HPC:speedup_obs} several kind of speedup can be observed. 
\paragraph{Linear}
The linear speedup usually represent the target for every programs in HPC. 
Indeed having the speedup growing exactly as the number of processors grows is the ideal case. 
Codes fall typical into two cases. 
\paragraph{Typical speedup}
This represents the most common observed speedup. 
As the number of processors grows, the program face several of the HPC walls, the hardest being communications.
So the increasing number of computational power is reduiced to the sequential pqrt or lose time in exchanges. 
\paragraph{Hyperlinear speedup}
In some cases we can observe an hyperlinear speedup, meaning that the results in parallel are even better than the ideal case. 
Several explainations can be given. 
The program can fit exactly in memory for less data on each processors or even fir perfectly for the cache utilization. 
The parallel algorithm can also be way more efficient than the sequential one. 

And the efficiency is defined by the speedup devided by the number of workers: 
\begin{equation}
\text{efficiency} = \frac{S_n}{n} = \frac{T_1}{nT_n}
\end{equation}

The efficiency, usually expressed in percent, represent the evolution of the code stability to growing number of processors. 


\subsection{Scalability}

\section{Amdhal's and Gustafson's law}

The Amdhal's and Gustafson's law show us how to be able to evaluate the maximal available speedup for an application taking in account different characteristics. 

\subsection{Amdahl's law}

The Amdahl's law\cite{amdahl1967validity} is use to find the theoretical speedup in latency of a program.
We can separate a program in two parts, the one that can be execute in parallel and the one that is sequential. 
And even if we reduce the parallel part to infinite the sequential part will reach 100\% of the total time. 

Extracted from the Amdahl paper the law can be writen as: 

\begin{equation}
Speedup = \frac{1}{Seq + \frac{Par}{n}}
\end{equation}

Where $Seq + Par = 1$ and $Seq$ and $Par$ respectively the sequential and parallel ratio of a program.

This is also called strong scaling.  

And the efficiency become:
\begin{equation}
Efficiency = \frac{n}{Seq + \frac{Par}{n}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Gustafson's law}

The Amdhal's law is focused on problem with the same memory size. 
John L. Gustafson's idea is that using more computational units, the problem size can grow accordingly. 
He considered a constant computation time with evolving problem size. 
With this point of view using more computational units leads to better results 

The speedup:
\begin{equation}
Speedup = Seq + Par \times n
\end{equation}

\section{Von Neumann Model}

First computers in early 19th were built using vacuum tubes instead of transistors making them very huge. 
One of the previous, ENIAC, was based on decimal and one of the first binary was construct around 1944, the Electric Discrete Variable Automatic Computer (EDVAC). 
In the EDVAC team, a physists described the logical model of this computer and provide a model on which every computing device is based nowadays. 
John Von Neumann published its \textit{First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC}~\cite{von1993first} in 1945. 
Every devices are now built around this model with optimizations on size, clock speed, memory, etc.

\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Von Neumann model}
\label{fig:1_HPC:von_neumann_model}
\end{figure}

This model is presented on Fig.~\ref{fig:1_HPC:von_neumann_model}.
The input device and output device are devices use to store in a read/write way data.
Inside the main box in the figure we find the memory, for the most common nowaday architecture we can consider it as a Random Access Memory (RAM). Several kind of memory exists and will be discussed later. 
The Central Processing Unit, CPU, is composed of several elements in this model. 
On one hand, the Arithmetic and Logic Unit, ALU, which take as input one or two values and apply an operation on those data. 
They can be either logics like AND, OR, XOR, etc. or arithmetique like ADD, MUL, SUB, etc.
On the other hand, the Control Unit, CU, which control the data carriage to the ALU from the memory on one way and the other. 

This is the basic model, some ones add another layer in the CPU called registers, to store the local data of the ALU.

\section{Flynn taxonomy and executions models}

A right characterization of what a sequential and a parallel machine provide is essential in order to be able to target the architecture in the way they are built.
The flynn taxonomy presents a hierarchical organization of computation machine and executions models.
In this classification \cite{flynn1972some}, Michael J. Flynn present the SIMD,SISI, MISD and MIMD.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{| l | l | l |}
						& Single Data (SD) 	& Multiple Data (MD) \\
\hline
Single Instruction (SI)		&  SISD			& SIMD \\
\hline
Multiple Instructions (MI) 	& 	MISD		& MIMD \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Single Instruction, Single Data: SISD}
This is the model corresponding to a single core CPU with no data parallelism. 
This sequential model is one instruction operate on one data which is then store and the process continue over. 

\subsection{Single Instruction, Multiple Data: SIMD}
This is the execution model corresponding to a many-core architecture like a GPU. 
In the same clock, the same operation is executed on every process on different data. 
The best example stay the work on matrices like a stencil. 

\subsection{Multiple Instructions, Multiple Data: MIMD}

\subsection{Multiple Instructions, Single Data: MISD}
This last model can correspond to a pipeline but even in this case the data are modified after every operations. 

\section{Memory models}
The most common memory models for shared memory are: 
\subsection{UMA}
\subsection{NUMA}

Non Unified Memory Access, 

\subsection{COMA}

\section{Introduction}

Optimization can't be done without a good knowledge of the machine architecture. 
Indeed, nowaday software and API try to take care of most of the cases but the last percent of gain have to be architecture dependent. 
In this chapter we will describe the most important devices architecures from classical Central Processing Units (CPUs), General Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs).
Then those independants elements are use together in order to build supercomputers. 
The way they are arranged and the nodes interconnection is something that really matter at large scale.  

\section{Architectures}
\subsection{Classical CPU}

The CPU, as we know it today, begin its history with \textit{Texas Instruments Inc} and the first patent describing a CPU is "Computing systems cpu" proposed by \textit{Gary Boone} and published in 1973.
This first fonctional processing unit on chip and is based on the Von Neumann Model.
Before that vacuum tubes were used instead of transistors making the space used very high.

The Von Neumann model can be extracted for the first time by the physists John Von Neumann and its team in \cite{} 
The Electric Discrete Variable Automatic Computer (EDVAC) presented in this paper was one of the first binary computer built with vacuum tubes. Von Neumann came in the project and summarized the logical aspects of this machine. 
This model is presented on Fig.~\ref{}.
since, every devices can be represented based on that model with optimizations in term of number of cores, memory accesses and bus. 




Talk about the ARM architecture 

\subsection{GPGPU}

GPUs are based on the SIMD model of the Flynn taxonomy presented previously, \emph{Single Instruction, Multiple Data}.
The specific execution model is called SIMT (\emph{Single Instruction, Multiple Thread}). It enables the execution of millions of coordinated threads in a data-parallel mode. 
Two main companies provide GPGPUs for the HPC world NVIDIA and AMD, we will present them in that order and conclude on the differences. 

\subsubsection{NVIDIA GPU architecture}

The NVIDIA company was fonded in April 1993 in Santa Clara, Carolina, by three persons in which Jensen Huang, the actual CEO.
Its name seems to come from \textit{invidia} the latin word for Envy and vision, for the graphics generation. 

Known as the pioner in graphics, cryptocurrency, portable devices and now AI, it seems to be even the creator of the name "GPU".
It GPU, inspired from visualisation and gaming at a first glance, is available as a dedicated device  since the Tesla. 
The public GPUs can also be use for dedicated computation but does not feature eMMC memory, double precision or special functions/FFT cores. 

We will describe here the Kepler architecture, this is the one we worked

\begin{figure*}[t!]

\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{figures/chap1/smx}
\caption{NVIDIA GPU and CUDA architecture overview}
 \label{fig:chap1_gpu}
%\vspace{-0.8cm} 
\end{figure*}

As presented in Fig.\ref{fig:chap1_gpu}, NVIDIA GPUs include many \emph{Streaming Multiprocessors} (SM), each of which is composed of many \emph{Streaming Processors} (SP). In the Kepler architecture, the SM new generation is called SMX.
%
%In the CUDA programing model~\cite{cuda}, the GPU works as a SIMT co-processor of a conventional CPU. 
Grouped into \emph{blocks}, \textit{threads} execute \emph{kernel} functions synchronously.
Threads within a block can cooperate by sharing data on an SMX and synchronizing their execution to coordinate memory accesses; inside a block, the scheduler organizes \emph{warps} of 32 threads which execute the instructions simultaneously.
The blocks are distributed over the GPU SMXs to be executed independently.

\subsubsection{Memory, bandwidth and streams:}

In order to use data in a CUDA kernel, it has to be first created on the CPU, allocated on the GPU and then transferred from the CPU to the GPU; after the kernel execution, the results have to be transferred back from the GPU to the CPU. 
GPUs consist of several memory categories, organized hierarchically and differing by size, bandwidth and latency.   
On the one hand, the device's main memory is relatively large but has a slow access time due to a huge latency. 
On the other hand, each SMX has a small amount of shared memory and L1 cache, accessible by its SPs, with faster access, and registers organized as an SP-local memory. 
SMXs also have a constant memory cache and a texture memory cache.
%, that are linked to the constant and texture memories physically located in the device memory: these are read-only and have faster access time than the rest of the memory categories.
Reaching optimal computing efficiency requires considerable effort while programming.
Most of the global memory latency can then be hidden by the threads scheduler if there is enough computational effort to be executed while waiting for the global memory access to complete. Another way to hide this latency is to use streams to overlap kernel computation and memory load. 

\subsubsection{Threads synchronization:}
It is also important to note that branching instructions may break the threads synchronous execution inside a warp and thus affect the program efficiency. 
This is the reason why test-based applications, like combinatorial problems that are inherently irregular, are considered as bad candidates for GPU implementation. 
%This is particularly true with regard to combinatorial problems resolution. 
Thus we intend to provide a way to regularize their execution, in order to get good acceleration with GPU computation.
