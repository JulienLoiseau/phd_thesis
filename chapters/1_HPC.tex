\chapter{HPC and Exascale}


\section{Introduction}

We only consider homogenes cluster in that work.

\section{Parallelism}

\subsection{Flynn taxonomy}

The flynn taxonomy presents a hierarchical organization of computation machine.

In this classification \cite{flynn1972some}, Michael J. Flynn present the SIMD, SISI, MISD and MIMD.
Add table and present some example of machines

\subsection{Goals}

\subsubsection{Speedup}

Speedup can be separate in two parts, Latency and Throughput.

\subsection{Bottlenecks}

\subsection{Amdahl and Gustafson}

The Amdahl's\cite{amdahl1967validity} law is use to find the theoretical speedup in latency of a program.
We can separate a program in two parts, the one that can be execute in parallel and the one that is sequential. And even if we reduce the parallel part to infinite the sequential part will reach 100\% of the total time.
